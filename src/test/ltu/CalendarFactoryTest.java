     * This test is interesting.
     * It seems that return calendar from initCalendar results in
     * the assertNull fail. it seems that there is actually a CalendarImpl
     * returned. I don't understand why.
     *
     * todo Ask this question above.
     *
     * The solution is to assert that in fact what is returned is in fact an
     * CalendarImpl.class... but I still don't know why! my theory is
     * that it must be because the empty constructor is called somehow.
     *
     * Also it is strange that when running the test individually in the IDE
     * it does not fail... only when run as a suite.
